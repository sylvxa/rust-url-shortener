# rust-url-shortener
Simple and semi-blazingly-fast url shortener written in Rust using Rocket and SQLite.

## Disclaimer
Firstly, ~~the code for this is *heavily* catered towards [blÃ¥haj.mom](https://blahaj.mom)~~, so if you want to self-host please rebrand it. (Credit would be nice, though!) Secondly, this is my first production Rust program so bugs are EXPECTED, feel free to mess around with the live demo and report bugs to me on my [contact page](https://sylvie.lol/contact) or fix them yourself in a PR.

> I no longer own the domain the live demo was under, sorry!
